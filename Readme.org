This repository hosts documentation, source code and all other files
related to MobileOrg v2. Whereas feature requests are handled in the

here.

Feature Requests which are related to the [[https://github.com/MobileOrg/mobileorg/milestone/1][v2 Milestone]] will be

To allow discussions on the specification there is a branch
